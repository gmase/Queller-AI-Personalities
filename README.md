Queller AI Personalities
========================

Personalities for use with the [Queller AI](https://github.com/Quitch/Queller-AI) server mod for [Planetary Annihilation](http://www.uberent.com/pa).

This mod adds additional personalities (also incorrectly called difficulty levels) to the game. The [Queller AI](https://github.com/Quitch/Queller-AI) mod uses these to modify its behviour to suit the preferences of the player.

### Subpersonalities

By default, Queller at Uber level will adapt its play to try and suit the system and the opposition it faces. You can use subpersonalities to customise Queller's game to your liking, or help it play better where it's making poor strategy choices.

Normal through Absurd are the standard difficulties and will use the vanilla AI rather than Queller.

- Adaptive
 - Primary bot focus
 - Will make decisions based on map size and enemy forces
 - Planned to become the default personality once the AI platoon attack bug is fixed

- Air
 - Near total focus on air units
 - Will develop naval as normal
 - Only uses bots on the ground

- Dox
 - Won't use any offensive T1 land unit other than the Dox
 - Will focus on Slammers at T2 but not exclusively
 - Will build a vehicle factory for Skitters if it detects the possibility of mines

- Eco
 - Heavier emphasis on economic growth
 - Works best on really large (900+ radius) planets with lots of metal
 - Aggressively techs so it can eco boom
 - Requires sizable distance from its opponent
 
- Grenadier
 - Uses the Grenadier alongside Dox
 - Will build a vehicle factory for Skitters if it detects the possibility of mines

- Infernodier
 - Starts out with Dox
 - Quickly switches to an Infernos and Grenadiers composition

- Tank
 - Currently the default Uber personality
 - Almost identical to Queller's fighting style prior to v2.1

 - Goes T2 as soon as it can afford to
 - Will get orbital as soon as possible on multi planet systems
 - Works best on multi planet systems where it spawns alone
