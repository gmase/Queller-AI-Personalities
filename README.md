Queller AI Personalities
========================

Personalities for use with the [Queller AI](https://github.com/Quitch/Queller-AI) server mod for [Planetary Annihilation](http://www.uberent.com/pa).

This mod adds additional personalities (also incorrectly called difficulty levels) to the game. The [Queller AI](https://github.com/Quitch/Queller-AI) mod uses these to modify its behviour to suit the preferences of the player.
